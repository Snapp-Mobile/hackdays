Hey @channel, we are planning to run a hack day on Friday, 30th of October. Mark your calendars!
This hack days' topic is Jetpack Compose. No previous experience needed!
Basically, we'll just explore Compose all day to get a feel for it and learn about it.

**Participating**

If you want to participate, please check with your project and let me know. This is, of course, part of your normal work time so only need to make sure the project doesn't have an important meetings etc. 
You can let the project team know that you'll be out that day.
This is completely optional and if you're not interested, that's fine. If you want to join the hacking, we have a dedicated channel where we'll be announcing details soon!
