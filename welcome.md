@channel Hey everyone! 
Welcome to our Hack Day!

#### What we’re doing today
You can work on whatever you want and learn however you want, e.g. just looking at the Compose Pathway and other resources.
We recommend getting some hands-on experience with Compose by building something yourself. 
If you’re looking for something to build, we’d love to work on a Compose version of TodoQ.
We created issues that you can grab. Just assign them to you if you’re working on them.
Things are very similar to the last hack day, but we have a (suggested) agenda today:

#### (Suggested) Agenda
- Meet at 10am CEST
- Learning Phase until 12pm CEST
- Pair Coding Time!
- Meet in Slack at the end of the day (around 4pm CEST), look at what we’ve built and what everybody learned

#### Learning Phase
This is all about learning Compose. Read blog posts, follow up with the resources for things you were stuck with, build something if you want!
We want to make sure everybody can work on something together, so we limited this time. If you don't feel like pair coding/wanna dig into other stuff past 12pm, that's cool too though!

#### Pair/Mob Coding Time
Pair/Mob Coding can provide lots of value for learning things. We suggest that folks work together with somebody to help share your experience and build something cool.
Logistics

If you have any questions or stuff is not working, this channel and #android are the right places to ask!
I posted two more resources in one of the pinned threads too!
We'll meet in a Google Meet at 10am CEST (in 45 mins) - make sure to update your Android Studio to the latest Canary before or during that :slightly_smiling_face: No worries if you can't join the kick-off meeting
